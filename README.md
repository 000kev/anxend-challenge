## Anxend Project 1 Submission

### Project 1:

Create a page with a form to add a school and it's address to the database.
With that form created add a handful of schools and then display (on the same page or a new one) a list of schools filtered for your home town (CapeTown, London etc..).
No visual or styling needed for this task.
